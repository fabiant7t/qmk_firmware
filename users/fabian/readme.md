# Personal preferences and what to expect
- I prefer ortholinear over staggered keyboards (but own quite a lot of both).
- I like 40% keyboards and use Mod-Tap quite a lot.
- I am a Colemak layout user (with a history of QWERTY and QWERTZ).
- I prefer the ANSI over the ISO layout.
- I write code and need to type []{}():; quite often.
- I write english and german texts and need the AltGr modifier for ÄÖÜäöüß.
- I prefer Linux over macOS, but use both (so both Ctrl and GUI).
- I am a vim user (so my left pinkie hits Ctrl and Esc on CapsLock).
- I use Space as a modifier to interact with my window manager ([i3](https://i3wm.org/))
